# Auto Route Minimal Starter Scaffold

A mimimal project scaffold to help you quickly get up-and-running with a simple app that uses navigation tabs
and auto_route with Flutter. The files are heavily commented to help serve as a hands on learning tool, aiming
to be accessible and not overwhelming.

It is highly reccomended to head on over to: [https://github.com/Milad-Akarie/auto_route_library#readme](https://github.com/Milad-Akarie/auto_route_library#readme) to learn more about this package, and how you can expand on
this very simple starter to build more complex projects.

## Getting Started

- `flutter pub get`
- `flutter run`
- Navigate to `main.dart` and follow the comments/guidance.
- Navigate to `screens/main_screen.dart` to learn how the parent scaffold route is set up.
- Browse/Edit the files in `screens/*` to modify tab content
- Build a cool app! (now that you are armed with a powerful declarative routing system)

**NOTE:** If you are using this as a template, you should first do a find/replace throughout the entire project directory to replace `auto_route_app_scaffold` with your chosen project/package name.

## Contributions Welcome!

I built this simple project while learning how to implement routing via Auto Route. I wanted to share a minimal distillation of a working router for others 
to build off of (and maybe for future projects of my own). 

By no means to I expect this to be a perfect implementation, and I welcome PRs with suggestions for cleaning up the code. 
The main goal here, though, is that this is not meant be an overly complex starting point.
